# Mobile Development Assessment (5+ Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Senior** mobile development assessment! Your task is to create a mobile app that demonstrates your architectural skills, performance optimization, and advanced mobile development patterns. This assessment is designed to take **1-2 hours** of coding time, but you have **1-2 days** to complete it.

## Task Summary

1. Create a mobile app with clean architecture
2. Implement advanced state management
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Demonstrate proper error handling and testing patterns

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment](https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codebility-assessment.git
cd codebility-assessment/mobile-fresh
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b firstname-lastname/mobile-5-years-plus
```

Replace `firstname-lastname` with your actual name.

### 4. Setup the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 5. Implementation

Create a mobile app that demonstrates these advanced concepts:

1. **Clean Architecture**:
   - Implement proper separation of concerns
   - Use repository pattern for data access
   - Create service layers for business logic
   - Organize code with clear folder structure

2. **Advanced State Management**:
   - Implement sophisticated state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, etc.)
   - Handle complex state scenarios
   - Implement proper state persistence
   - Add state debugging tools

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement proper list virtualization
   - Add image optimization and caching
   - Implement lazy loading for components
   - Add performance monitoring

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement offline-first architecture
   - Add push notifications (mock implementation)
   - Create complex navigation patterns
   - Add deep linking support

5. **Testing & Quality**:
   - Add unit tests for critical components
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Include performance monitoring

6. **UI/UX Excellence**:
   - Create polished, production-ready UI
   - Implement smooth animations
   - Add accessibility features
   - Create responsive design for all screen sizes

### 6. Test Your Work

1. Test your app thoroughly on different platforms
2. Verify performance on slower devices
3. Check error handling and edge cases
4. Test offline functionality

### 7. Submit Your Work

1. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement mobile app with clean architecture and advanced features"
   git push origin firstname-lastname/mobile-5-years-plus
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Contribute" and "Open pull request"
   - Make sure the base repository is set to `Zeff01/codebility-assessment`
   - Include a detailed explanation of your architectural decisions and any trade-offs made

## What We're Looking For

- Clean architecture and code organization
- Advanced state management patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
- Comprehensive error handling
- Production-ready code quality
- Modern mobile development best practices

## Technology Choices

- Use React Native with Expo
- Choose advanced state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, etc.)
- Implement proper testing (Jest, React Native Testing Library)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Choose any additional libraries that fit your architecture

## Time Allowance

- **Expected coding time**: 1-2 hours
- **Submission deadline**: 1-2 days

Focus on demonstrating your architectural thinking and attention to performance rather than implementing many features. Quality and maintainability are key.

## Additional Notes

- Include a brief README explaining your architecture decisions
- Document any shortcuts taken due to time constraints
- Explain your approach to state management and performance optimization
- Highlight any trade-offs you made in your implementation

**Good luck!**
